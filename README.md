# AlgorithmPractice
This originally was just going to be a gist. As the scope of the C# solution expanded to include additional classes and unit tests it quickly became apparant that it would be best to preserve the work remotely as a complete C# solution.  

Originally debugging consisted of running the console application and visually confirming the output.  As the scope and complexity of the algorithms increased work slowed.  So I started TDD (Test Driven Development) to very quickly get a sense of how my algorithms were functioning and troubleshoot issues by comparing the expected values to actual values.  This had the added benefit of preventing regressions as I tweaking the algorithm instructions to accomodate edge cases and correct off-by-one errors.

Bit operations in particular fascinated me, since they represent the fundamental building blocks of all other operations in Computer Science.  The BitOp class represents my attempts to derive all the arithmetic operators from just the standard bit operations & (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), ~ (NOT), << and >> (left and right arithmetic shift). The trickiest thing for me to wrap my head around was 2's compliment representation for signed integers. The best way I found to think of two's complement is prepending a 1 to the binary value to make it negative. The magnitude of the number then works in reverse. So for a 4 bit two's complement 1111 equals -1, 1110 equals -2 and so on until you get to 1000, or -7.
